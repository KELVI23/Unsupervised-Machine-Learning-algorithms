## Conclusion

K-means partitions customers into 3 mutually exclusive clusters.
The customers in each cluster are similar to each other demographically. Now we can create a profile for each group, considering the common characteristics of each cluster.
These 3 clusters can be:

	####   AFFLUENT, EDUCATED AND OLD AGED
	
	####    MIDDLE AGED AND MIDDLE INCOME
	
	####    YOUNG AND LOW INCOME
